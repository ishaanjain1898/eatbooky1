Indians are by nature known to spend lavishly on weddings; even the balanced middle class will take out their life's saving and spend generously on their children's wedding. How much noise we all make about our economic development in India but we can never deny the fact that our country also hosts one of the biggest population of starving people in the world. We need to realise that there are so many people out there who barely manage a single meal a day. We all have attended Indian wedding parties but how many of us realise how much food goes into waste during such functions? And how many have noticed poor kids scanning the garbage bin to get something to eat? Biggest source of food wasted is in Indian weddings. The way food is eaten and wasted in weddings is an eye opener for everybody because extra food has been prepared to make sure everyone is well fed knowing the fact of their expected wastage. Piles of dishes of excess food are thrown. And still we see the kind of wastage of food in weddings. To avoid the wastage of food, the left over should be given to the neighbours, or the nearby poor people or should be sent to the orphanage Minimising food wastage is something that all of us individually can work towards and in the process help those who are not as fortunate as we are.
